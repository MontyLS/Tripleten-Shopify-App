# 📊 Shopify App Reviews Analysis | Power BI Dashboard

This project explores patterns in Shopify app reviews using Power BI to identify which developers and apps are generating the most user engagement, satisfaction, and helpful responses.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze over 7,000 Shopify app reviews scraped from public sources on the Shopify App Store. The goal was to:

- Identify trends in user ratings and feedback volume.
- Compare developer engagement by response rates.
- Uncover insights into which app developers deliver the best user experience.

Built entirely in **Power BI**, this dashboard uses review metrics like count, helpfulness, and developer replies to provide a holistic view of app performance across the Shopify ecosystem.
